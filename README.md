# dsa_python

A collection of essential code to understand and practice data structures and algorithms in Python.

## Features

- Implementations of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Classic algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Well-commented and beginner-friendly code
- Example problems and solutions

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaibhav-k/dsa_python.git
cd dsa_python
```

## Usage

You can import the modules and use the functions/classes as needed. For example:

```python
from data_structures.single_linked_list import LinkedList
ll = LinkedList()           # Expected: empty linked list
ll.append(1)                # Expected: linked list with [1]
ll.append(2)                # Expected: linked list with [1, 2]
print(ll)                   # Expected output: [1, 2]
```
